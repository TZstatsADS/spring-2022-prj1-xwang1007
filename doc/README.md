# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the history of philosophy

### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

The file 'Proj1_pre' is the presentation file(or you may see it as a report file). Though I did not include codes, I explained the whole process and the idea of my project, and the figures 'pasted' in this file could be found in corresponding code files.
